Computational_Physics-Integral
=========================================

This was an assignment in my Computational Physics class on understanding doing integral using various
computational methods. The focus was on using the second order trapezoid method, a more accurate adaptive
trapezoid method, and a third order Simpson's method. The code was all written in C and makes use of function
pointers and memory allocation using MALLOC.
